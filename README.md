### Summary
This is a small exploratory data analysis and data visualization project on digital transcation using PoS( Point of sale) terminals before and after demonetisation in india.
Digital payments using debit and credit cards at Point of Sale (Pos) terminals has accelerated very quickly after demonetisation and goverment's effort to push for digital payments. Post-demonetisation, banks have been able to install large number of PoS terminals. As a result, we have observed sharp growth in digital payments. Here I will explore how the picture of digital payment has changed after demonetisation. 

### Objectives of this project
* To clean multiple data files (total 24 files but very small in size !) which I have downloaded from https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/ATMView.aspx.
* To merge cleaned data together which is fragmented in total 24 data files. 
* To do exploratory data analysis using data visualization.

### Installation and setup instructions
R and R studios
 * Download and install [R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN](http://www.r-project.org/), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It is highly recommended to install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system â€“ use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked to above!
 * Install RStudio's IDE (stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user interface for R: http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/
