This is a small exploratory data analysis and data visualization project on digital transcation using PoS( Point of sale) terminals before and after demonetization in india.

### Introduction
Digital payments using debit and credit cards at Point of Sale (Pos) terminals has accelerated very quickly after demonetisation and goverment's effort to push for digital payments. Post-demonetisation, banks have been able to install large number of PoS terminals. As a result, we have observed sharp growth in digital payments.

Here we will clean datasets from https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/ATMView.aspx and then merge them together for time series analysis of PoS transaction uding january 2016 to december 2017.
